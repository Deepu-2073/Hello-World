 <h2 style="color:red;">FEELINGS</h2>
<p>The moment,I see you,<br> 
Everything fades except u,<br> 
I don't have my control over me,<br> 
What magic have u made on me,<br> 
I want to love you,<br> 
Bt i have the fear to lose myself in u;<br><br>


       Whenever i come to know, <br>
       U r coming around me,<br> 
       I start thinking about you,<br>
      What i have to do when u r before me,<br>
      I  slate the things,<br> 
      In a particular sequence to do, <br>
    I want to love you,<br> 
    Bt i have the fear to lose myself in u; <br><br>


To know the reason <br>
I sit alone in a corner,<br> 
I feel you this moment, <br>
Endeavor to know the answer from this loneliness,<br> 
I want to love you, <br>
Bt i have the fear to lose myself in u;<br><br>


Weather is so pleasant today,<br>
It is also accompanying me,<br> 
Bt Still i don't get, <br>
Why this happens to me, <br>
I want to love you,<br> 
Bt I have the fear to lose myself in u; <br><br>


All these things start making chaos in my mind,<br>
And my heart is paining , <br>
To just get it in my  heart,<br>
I have to have a word with myself and this moment, <br>
I want to love you,<br> 
Bt i have the fear to lose myself in u; <br><br>

While thinking about all these,<br> 
The things that came in my heart,<br> 
And satisfied me, Live the moment as it is, <br>
Coz modification eliminates the real taste of the moment ,<br> 
I want to love u,<br> 
Bt I have the fear to lose myself in u;<br>
